In this project, we determine the category of products and issues causing the highest number of complaints to facilitate the customers with better satisfaction. This analysis is done using the NoSQL FoundatonDB-PythonAPI.

Complete documentation of the FoundationDB Python API can be found at https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/api-python.html.
These bindings require the FoundationDB client. The client can be obtained from https://www.foundationdb.org/download/.
